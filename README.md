Only frontend in react
Made to work with Netlify

## Setup & Use

### Project Initialization

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them
- Clone this repo, enter it
- Run command `npm run setup`

### Available Commands
- `setup` : Initialization of frontend and backend, as well as all toolings
- `dev` : Starts frontend
- `lint` : Runs validation tools, and refuses unclean code (will be executed on every _commit_)
- `fix` : Fixes linter errors (run it if `lint` growls on your code !)
